I am still working on researching venues that can accommodate at least 250 people for the Tech Innovation Conference in San Francisco. Here are a few options that I have found so far:

- The Moscone Center is a premier convention venue known for its large-scale capacity and modern facilities. It's renowned for hosting major events such as the Game Developers Conference and the RSA Conference.

- Bespoke Events offers the first event, co-working, and tech demo space designed to foster a retail-tech community and to support innovation. Bash Buzz Bespoke has a capacity of 250 people and offers a variety of amenities, including a full kitchen, a bar, and a lounge area.

- The CANOPY - Pacific Heights is a boutique hotel with a variety of event spaces, including a ballroom that can accommodate up to 250 people. The hotel is located in the Pacific Heights neighborhood, which is known for its beautiful architecture and upscale shopping.

I will continue to research and provide you with more options as they become available.
